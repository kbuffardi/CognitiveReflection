## Thinking Fast, and Slow

## Behavioral Economics

The **Cognitive Reflection Test** ([Frederick
2005](https://doi.org/10.1257%2F089533005775196732)) was motivated by
Tversky and Kahneman‚Äôs research that lead to a Nobel Prize in Economics.
They identified how consumers do not act in their rational best
interests because of cognitive biases.

In Kahneman‚Äôs best-selling book *Thinking, Fast and Slow* he described
our brain‚Äôs two systems of decision-making:

-   **System 1** is fast and reflexive and particularly susceptible to
    our emotions and intuitions
-   **System 2** is slower, deliberate, and utilizes conscious
    calculations and reasoning

The **Cognitive Reflection Test** is a proxy for how likely an
individual is to inhibit System 1 and demonstrate **Cognitive
Reflection** (using System 2). It is inversely correlated with:

-   Gambler‚Äôs fallacy
-   Sunk cost fallacy

**In what ways might ‚ÄúCognitive Reflection‚Äù play a role in software
engineering?**

# Results

## CRT vs Inspection

-   CRT was **not a significant predictor** (p=0.329) of students‚Äô
    **affirmation of acceptable code**.
-   CRT was a **significant predictor** of students rejecting defective
    code (p&lt;0.0001) with the log odds of **correctly rejecting the
    defective code** increasing by 2.94 (95% CI 1.56-4.50).
    -   When considering only students who proposed cases that caused a
        defect, we found that **CRT was a significant predictor**
        (p&lt;0.001) of students **identifying a defective case** with
        the log odds of doing so increasing by 2.37 (95% CI 1.05-3.86)

## CRT vs Testing

-   CRT was **not correlated with test accuracy** (œÅ=0.940, p=0.008).
    -   Test effectiveness (M=0.66, sd=0.27) was **not correlated with
        CRT** (œÅ=0.140, p=0.159)
    -   Test affirmation (M=0.76, sd=0.17) was **not correlated with
        CRT** (œÅ= -0.199, p=0.045)

## Conclusions
